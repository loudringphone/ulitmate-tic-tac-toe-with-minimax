# Ultimate Tic Tac Toe with Minimax


You can try the game on https://loudringphone.github.io/ultimate-tic-tac-toe-with-minimax/


Unlike the simple Tic Tac Toe that only needs the basic form of minimax, Ultimate Tic Tac Toe(UTT) requires board evaluation and alpha beta pruning. A maximium depth is also required to determine how far the algorithm will search into the game tree as otherwise it will exhaust all the computational resources.


Please note that minimax use computational resources to explore the game tree, so preferably run the game on your laptop or PC instead of on your mobile.
